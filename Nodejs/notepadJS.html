	<h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>

	<p>JavaScript can change HTML attribute values.</p>

	<p>In this case JavaScript Changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an image.</p>

	<button onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='pic_bulbon.gif'">Turn on the light</button>

	<img id="myImage" src="pic_bulboff.gif" style="width:100px">

	<button onclick="ducoment.getElementById('myImage').src="pic_bulboff.gif'">Turn off the light</button>

</body>
</html>

<!-- JS WHERE TOO SCRIPT TAGGING-->
<!-- In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags -->

<script>
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>

<!-- A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. 
	For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button. -->

<!-- JavaScript can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
	In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the <head> section of a HTML page.
		The function is called when a button is clicked: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Function Test</title>
	<script>
		function myFunction() {
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
		}
	</script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>A Web Page</h1>
	<p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
</body>
</html>

<!-- Scripts can also be placed in external JavaScript files
	so the function call of
		function myFuction() {
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
		}
	can be stored and called upon rather than written out,
	this saves a bunch of code written into the HTML and cached JavaScript files can speed up page loading
		to call upon this script you'd change it too -->

<script src="scriptfile.js"></script>
<script src="scriptfile2.js"></script>

<!-- External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or a with path relative to the current web page
	this example uses a full URL to link to a script -->

<script src="http://www.w3schools.com/js/scriptfile.js"></script>

<!-- From a local file located in a specified folder on the current web site -->

<script src="/js/scriptfile.js"></script>


<!-- JAVASCRIPT OUTPUT 
	JavaScript Display Possibilities
		Javascript can display data in different ways:
			Writing into a HTML element, using innerHTML
			Writing into the HTML output using document.write()
			Writing into an alert box, using window.alert()
			Writing into the browser console, using console.log() -->

<!-- Using innerHTML
		To access a HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method
		To id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>JS Output</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
	<p>My First Paragraph</p>

	<p id="demo"></p>
	<script>
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
	</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- for testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write(): 
	using a document.write after a HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>JS Output</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
	<p>My First Paragraph</p>

	<button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try It</button>
</body>
</html>

<!-- the document.write() method should only be used for testing -->

<!-- USING window.alert() 
	You can use an alert box to display data -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>JS Output</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
	<p>My First Paragraph</p>

	<script>
		window.alert(5 + 6);
	</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- using console.log() 
	for debugging purposes, you can use the console.log() method to display data to check it runs correctly -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>JS Output</title>
</head>
<body>
	<script>
		console.log(5 + 6);
	</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- JAVASCRIPT STATEMENTS SEE NOTEPADJS.js -->

<!-- writing the script directly into HTML -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
	<title>JavaScript statements</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>JavaScript Statements</h1>
	<p>A <b>JavaScript Program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

	<p id="demo"></p>

	<script>
		var = x, y, z,; // statement 1
		x = 5; // statement 2
		y = 6; // statement 3
		z = x + y // statement 4

	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The value of z is " + z + " . ";

	</script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- this script will execute that z is 11 -->

<!-- JAVASCRIPT EVENTS (LINE 1097 CSS) -->
 <!-- HTML events can be used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events
 	A HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
 		Some examples of HTML events
 			A HTML Web Page has finished loading
 			A HTML Input field was changed
 			A HTML Button was clicked
 	Often whe events happen, you may want to do something
 	Javascript lets you execute code when events are detected
 	HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements -->
 <element event="some JavaScript">
 	<!-- in the following example, a onclick attritube is added to a button element -->
 <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
 	<!-- Above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo"
 		In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML) -->

 <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
 	<!-- JavaScript code is often several lines long, 
 			it is more comment to see the event attributes calling functions -->

 <button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

 <!-- COMMON HTML EVENTS
 		this is only a list of common ones, see bookmark HTML/CSS DOM
 	EVENT 							DESCRIPTION -->
 <onchange></onchange>				A Html Element Has Been Changed
 <onclick></onclick>				The user clicks a HTML Element
 <onmouserover></onmouserover>		The user moves the mouse over a HTML element
 <onmouseout></onmouseout>			The user moves the mouse away from a HTML element
 <onkeydown></onkeydown>			The user pushes a keyboard key
 <onload></onload>					The browser has finished loading the page

<!-- What can JavaScript Do?
	Evenet Handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions and browser actions
		Things that should be done every time a page loads
		Things that should be done when the page is closed
		Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
		Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
		And more...

	Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:
		HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
		HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions 
		You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
		You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
