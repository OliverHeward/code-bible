/* SEPERATE CONTAINER COMPONNTS FROM PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENTS: EXPLANATION

In this session we'll learn a second programming pattern;
	seperating presentational components from display components.

Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern.

Here's the basic idea behind it,
	if a component has to have 'state',
	make calculations based on props,
	or manage any other complex logic, 
	then that component shouldn't also have to render HTML-like JSX.

Instead of rendering HTML-like JSX,
	the component should render another component.
It should be that component's job to render HTML-like JSX.

Following this pattern seperates your business logic from your presentational logic, which is a good thing :)
