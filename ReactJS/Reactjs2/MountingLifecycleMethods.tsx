// MOUNTING LIFECYCLE METHODS 

/* What's a Lifecycle Method?

	Lifecycle methods are methods that get called at certain moments in a components life.

	You can write a lifecycle method that gets calle right before a component renders for the first time.

	You can write a lifecycle method that gets called right after a component renders, every time expect for the first time.

	You can attach lifecycle methods to a lot of different moments in a components life. This has powerful implications!

	In this unit, we will walk through each lifecycle method!

*/ 


/* Mounting Lifecycle Methods 

	There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting. This lession is about the first category: Mounting lifecycle methods. 

	A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

	There are three mounting lifecycle methods: 

		- componentWillMount

		- render

		- componentDidMount

	When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in order.

*/


/*	componentWillMount
		The first mounting lifecycle method is called componentWillMount.

		When a component renders for the first time, componentWillMount gets called right before render.

		Look at Example.js, and follow these steps:

		On lines 14-17, <Example /> is rendered for the first time. <Example />â€˜s mounting period begins.
			<Example /> calls the first mounting lifecycle method, componentWillMount.
				componentWillMount executes, and an alert appears on the screen. (lines 5-7)
			After componentWillMount has finished, <Example /> calls the second mounting lifecycle method: render.
				<h1>Hello world</h1> appears on the screen (lines 9-11)
			Two seconds later, <Example /> renders again (lines 20-22). componentWillMount does NOT get called, because mounting lifecycle events only execute the first time that a component renders.
			You can call this.setState from within componentWillMount!

			Look at Example2.js for an example of this.setState inside of componentWillMount. See if you can follow how <Example2 /> would render <h1>Hello world</h1>.

/*	Render

	'render' is a lifecycle method! 

	We won't go over 'render' here - we've already talked about it plenty. However, you should understand how render fits into the mounting period. Whenever a component mounts, 'componentWillMount' is called first, followed by 'render', followed by 'componentDidMount'.

	'render' belongs to two categories: mounting lifecycle methods, and updating lifecycle methods. We'll cover updating lifecycle methods in the next lesson. But first, there's one final mounting lifecycle method!
*/

/* 	componentDidMount

		The final mounting lifecycle method is called 'componentDidMount'.

		When a component renders for the first time, 'componentDidMount' gets called right after the HTML from 'render' has finished loading. Look below to see an example of componentDidMount.

export class Example extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {

/* componentDidMount gets used a lot!

	I your React App uses AJAX to fetch inital data from an API, then componentDidMount is the place to make that AJAX call. More generally, 'componentDidMount' is a good plac to connect a React app to external applications, such as web API's or JavaScript frameworks.
	'componentDidMount' is also the place to set timers using 'setTimeout' or 'setInterval'
